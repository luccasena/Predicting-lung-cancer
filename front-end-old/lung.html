                Lung Cancer: A Silent Threat
              </h1>
              <p class="txt-dark">
                Lung cancer is an insidious disease that develops in the tissues of the lungs, often presenting no noticeable symptoms in its early stages. This characteristic makes it particularly dangerous, as late diagnosis can significantly reduce the chances of effective treatment.

                Most Affected Population
            </h1>
            <p class="txt-dark">
                While lung cancer can affect anyone, some groups are at higher risk:
            </p>
            <p class="txt-buttom">
                <span>Individuals with a History of Smoking:</span> Smoking is the leading risk factor for lung cancer, and long-term smokers or those who smoked for many years are particularly vulnerable.
            </p>
            <p class="txt-buttom">
              <span>Personalize Treatment:</span> By leveraging predictive analytics, we can tailor treatment plans to individual patient needs, optimizing therapy and improving outcomes.
            </p>
    
            <p class="txt-buttom">
                <span>Those Exposed to Harmful Substances:</span> Exposure to substances such as radon, asbestos, and certain industrial chemicals also increases the risk.
            </p>
            <p class="txt-buttom">
                <span>Family History:</span> People with a family history of lung cancer may have a higher predisposition to the disease.
            </p>
            <p class="txt-buttom">
                <span>Advanced Age:</span> The risk of lung cancer increases with age, being more common in people over 50.
            </p>
            <p class="txt-buttom">
                <span>Detrimental Effects of Lung Cancer:</span> The detrimental effects of lung cancer are diverse and profoundly impact patients' quality of life               
            </p>
            <p class="txt-buttom">
                <span>Respiratory Difficulty:</span> Lung tumors can obstruct airways, causing shortness of breath, persistent cough, and chest pain.
            </p>
            <p class="txt-buttom">
                <span>Metastasis:</span> Lung cancer has a high capacity for metastasis, meaning it can spread to other organs, such as bones, the brain, and the liver, making treatment more complex.
            </p>
            <p class="txt-buttom">
                <span>Compromised Lung Function:</span> The disease can impair lung function, leading to the need for oxygen therapy and other forms of respiratory support.

            </p>
            <p class="txt-buttom">
                <span>Emotional Impact:</span> A lung cancer diagnosis can cause significant emotional distress, leading to anxiety, depression, and other mental health problems.
            </p>
            <p class="txt-buttom">
                <span>Reduced Quality of Life:</span> The symptoms and side effects of treatment can significantly reduce patients' quality of life, limiting their daily activities and overall well-being.
                Lung cancer is a serious disease that requires attention and care. Understanding its detrimental effects and the most affected population is essential to confronting this health threat.
